# GitlabBuiltBlog

This repository contains the content for a blog. I created the repository and files using GitLab, a Vagrant box, and Jekyll. The blog itself was built with jekyll and deployed to three AWS s3 buckets: a QA site, a Staging site, and a Production site. Next, I will be returning to java programming and the Spring Framework to build and release some more web application code. Questions? Feel free to reach out to me at Lookmanolowo@gmail.com!
