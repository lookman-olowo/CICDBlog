# CI/CD Test - Building a Blog

This repository contains the content for a blog. I created the repository and files using GitLab, a Vagrant box, and Jekyll. The jekyll blog site was built, tested, and deployed through a GitLap pipeline. The sites for QA, staging, and production are hosted in AWS s3 buckets. I'll be creating java web applications using Spring. Check back soon for updates. Questions? Feel free to reach out to me at Lookmanolowo@gmail.com.
